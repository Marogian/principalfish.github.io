    This map attempts to show how the 2017 election would have gone under the proposed boundary
    changes. The information displayed is not claimed to be definitive.

    Since ward by ward election results aren't publicly available, to estimate them I have
    been using local council results, scaling the turnout to the general election and
    redistributing discrepancies between the two.
