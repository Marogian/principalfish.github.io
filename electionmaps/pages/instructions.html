    <li>Added Brexit Party to the model, removed UKIP.</li>
    <li> This is a straight swap on the website at the moment. Will reimplement UKIP for previous elections at a later date.
    Vote change percentages will appear inaccurate for now. </li>
    <li>Change UK not going to be implemented while polling 1-2% </li>
    <li>Situation very unclear at the moment. Current model not great for the new parties and huge changes in polling numbers currently occurring.  </li>
    <li>Will put some thought into a new model when I have time. </li>
