				<h2> 2015 </h2>
				<h2>May</h2>
				<h3> 9th </h3>
				<h4> 2nd update </h4>
				<p> Reshuffled all the pages - 2010 parliament is now <a href="election2015/2010parliament.html">here</a>.</p>
				<p>New parliament is now <a href="election2015/currentparliament.html">here</a>.</p>

				<h3> 9th </h3>
				<p> First of all an apology for not getting the live map working.
					I couldn't get the data scraping working properly, it was in quite a different format to the one I had envisaged.
					I partially blame tiredness and partially shell shock at the exit poll but I'm mostly disappointed in myself that I couldn't get it working.</p>
				<p> It took me 2 hours yesterday afternoon after some sleep to get the thing working - you can see all the final data
					on the <a href="/election2015/live/"> Live Page</a>. I will probably move it from there eventually.</p>
				<p> The prediction was obviously way off - mostly attributable to pollsters getting it collectively completely wrong.
					Inputting the final percentages into my model gets Con 326 / Lab 239 / Lib 9 / SNP 52 so I feel my model was an ok represetation of votes - > seats. </p>
					<p>I believe it got the Lib Dem holds wrong - the wipe out in the South West in particular was not predicted with the end vote numbers. 		 </p>

					<p>The SNP surge is underrepresented but it's hard to model such an incredible swing.</p>
					<p> Will run a full test in the near future, possibly today and stick that map up.</p>


					<p> Doing this again may prove difficult due to potential boundary changes in the upcoming parliament but I may give it a go.</p>

				<h2>April</h2>
				<h3> 27th </h3>

				<h2>January </h2>
				<h3>28th - UK Election Map</h3>
				<p>Current UK parliament is <a href ="/election2015/current.html">complete</a>.
					Rendering is done using the <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3js</a> Javascript library.
					Has performance issues when zooming in Firefox but not much I can do about it - seems to be a widely reported problem.
					Stripped down to just the map the animations still lag.</p>
				<p>Working on a <a href ="/election2015">projection</a> for the 2015 election.
					Had a go at predicting Scotland but not satisfied with the power of spreadsheets to finish the task efficiently.
					Going to start work on analysing the data using Python next week. Installed python packages NumPy and SciPy to help out.
				<p> Also aiming to make a live map for the day of the election. </p>
				<h3>20th</h3>
			  <p> Site up and running.</p>
