				<p>
					I'm Phil. Born in Nottingham in 1988 I grew up in the North East of England,
					going to high school in Morpeth.
					I attended Durham University and studied Maths from 2006 to 2009.
					After graduating I spent 6 years playing poker for a living.
					During that time I lived in London and travelled around the world to play.
				</p>

				<p>
					Since 2014 I have been teaching myself to code with the aim of becoming a developer.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started with Python, moving on to Javascript
					and gaining experience with HTML/CSS, JQuery, Grunt, Sass, Node, d3js and a little SQL.
				</p>

				<p>
					I have always loved maps and followed politics closely so decided to combine
					the two and make a set of <a href="/electionmaps/">interactive UK Election Maps</a>.
					I aim to add to these by making US based ones in time for the mid-terms in 2018.

				</p>
				<p>
					In my spare time I enjoy hillwalking, amateur astronomy and playing Hearthstone.
