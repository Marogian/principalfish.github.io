				<h2>January </h2>
				<h3>28th - UK Election Map</h3>
				<p>Current UK parliament is <a href ="/election2015/current.html">complete</a>.
					Rendering is done using the <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3js</a> Javascript library.
					Has performance issues when zooming in Firefox but not much I can do about it - seems to be a widely reported problem.
					Stripped down to just the map the animations still lag.</p>
				<p>Working on a <a href ="/election2015">projection</a> for the 2015 election.
					Had a go at predicting Scotland but not satisfied with the power of spreadsheets to finish the task efficiently.
					Going to start work on analysing the data using Python next week. Installed python packages NumPy and SciPy to help out.
				<p> Also aiming to make a live map for the day of the election. </p>
				<h3>20th</h3>
			  <p> Site up and running.</p>
